## Data Sources

The data examined herein addresses the relationship between the rise in a state's population and an increase in the population density, and the number of UFO sightings reported.

U.S. census data is used to determine state populations and state population density rankings. These data are gathered every 10 years.

UFO reports were gathered from a dataset published on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings). These data were divided into decades based on the year in which they were reported, in order to assess UFO reports within the 10 years of the U.S. census data. These data ran from 1950-2010.

## Focus States

Selected top 11 states for most UFO sightings reported. It was assumed that this would create more consistent data to work from for UFO sightings, without focusing on state density.

Only 7 were high-density, 4 were low-density
